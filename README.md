# Python (P3) to x86

For more information see: A Problem Course in Compilation: From Python to x86 Assembly

Compile a single file into assembly:
```python compile.py file.py```

Run a single test named test.py: 
```python run_test.py test.py```

Run our test suite:
```python run.py```

Note that there are no ```input()``` calls in the tests, because this would ask the user to manually insert the same values twice.
If you want to test ```input()```, please use your own suitable test.
